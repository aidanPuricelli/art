Along the way, I have had countless friends and family inspire me and encourage my creative endeavors. To this, I owe them everything I have become today and am always and forever grateful for what they have pushed me to achieve. Without jumping into too many spoilers or general information, I encourage you to instead explore the writing, illustrations, and animations below.  Please don't hesitate to reach out to me privately through my contact page if you have any questions or inquiries at all regarding this project or my art. </p>
                <p className={`${ubuntu.className}`}>Thank you again to all my supportersâ€”and to you for stopping by my site!</p>
